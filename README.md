# JX8P controllers

Behringer BCR2000 or Novation SL Mk II as a MIDI controller for your Roland JX-8P.

## BCR2000 - How to

1. Download and install [BC Manager](https://mountainutilities.eu/bcmanager)
2. Upload the .bcr preset file to your BCR2000 using BC Manager
3. Make sure your BCR2000 is in a serial operation mode (S1 - S4)
4. Make sure SysEx mode on JX-8P is turned on (MIDI function 26, page 25 in manual)
5. Connect BCR2000's MIDI OUT A to JX-8P's MIDI IN
6. Print, cut and place the Layout as you like. The photo in this repo shows how it will look.

Enjoy!

## Novation SL Mk II

Secondly this repo contains two .syx preset files to control the JX-8P with a Novation (Zero) SL Mk II. I tried both, but prefer the BCR2000 because no menu diving is needed.
